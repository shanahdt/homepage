I've just returned from SMT Charlotte, where I presented a key-finding algorithm to the Music Cognition Interest Group, as well as a talk to the informatics group  on possible machine learning uses for gauging 
consistencies between music theory textbooks and workbooks. It was great to catch up with everyone.
